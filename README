=========

Introduction
------------

rss2maildir takes rss feeds and creates a maildir of messages for each of the
feeds, new items become "new", updated entries get redelivered as new messages.
Each feed becomes it's own maildir which can be named as you like.

Usage
-----

Create a config file containing the feeds and their "names" - the names will be
used as the directory name of the maildir for the feed.
