            <dt>What is HTML2Text?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>HTML2Text is a funky bit of python that translates HTML fragments in to plain text in a human readable format. It's primary use was for generating the plain text body of email messages generated from rssfeeds as part of rss2maildir.</p>
                <p>Hopefully one day it'll be good enough that other people will want to use it!</p>
