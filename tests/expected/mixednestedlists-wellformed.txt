   What is HTML2Text?::

   HTML2Text is a funky bit of python that translates HTML fragments
   in to plain text in a human readable format. It's primary use was
   for generating the plain text body of email messages generated from
   rssfeeds as part of rss2maildir.

   Hopefully one day it'll be good enough that other people will want
   to use it!

   Who wrote it?::
